Soncubine Project

Developing for both desktop and mobile. First attempt at a responsive design. Design was provided in inVision.

For this project, the most difficult part was getting to know how to use flexbox in place of old practices. It was much easier than my previous projects, but I'm glad to know that I am still continuously learning. I need to revisit the code again and make sure I understand why I did what I did. Responsive design wasn't as difficult as I imagined it would be, but still challenging since I haven't done it much. I'd like to do more research about using something other than pixels for media queries, ems/rems for margins and padding, and percentages for widths.
